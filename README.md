Template Style Guide for In House Web Teams

This is a template for an in-house style guide document. When I needed examples to write one for my job, I found lots of generic style guides, lots of style guides for agency work, but very few intended for in-house use. So I wrote my own.

This template has been genericize from an in-house style document written for a professional association, so you may need to customize it more or less for your own organization's needs, quirks, workflow, and bad habits to be corrected.
